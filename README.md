Theme Picked: Inventory Management​
At each store at Caratlane, we have a different amount of inventory. And all our inventory is recorded in our system. In this system, we have the product image, bar code, price and other information related to an available product. In the store, we have the physical product along with their bar code tags and SKU codes.
Whenever a sale happens, the sold product is archived from the system.
Now the issue is we do not have a register (or such) for where the product is located in the store room. Which rack and which row of which rack? 
Every day we do a “stock reconciliation,” which is whether the inventory mentioned in the system is present in the store as well. It’s a manual and long process that we do every day to ensure all the products are available.
Hence, we are looking for innovative ways to handle this problem.
Participants are expected to present unique solutions to the two major problems:
   Smart counting of stocks and verifying it against the system
   Automatic identification of the availability of particular item against the rack in physical store
   
   
comparison_part1.py is for Smart counting of stocks and verifying it against the system
search.py is for Automatic identification of the availability of particular item against the rack in physical store
sku_read.py is for reading SKU codes from live video feed
